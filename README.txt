1.The Code folder contains the following:
Python Script:AgglomerativeMin
Python Script DBScan
Python Script PlotScript
Java File KMeans_Hadoop

2.The two python scripts in the code folder viz AgglomerativeMin and DBScan are the scripts for Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering and DBSCAN respectively. These two files also have the code for PCA in it.

3.The KMeans_Hadoop file is the Java code for the Hadoop implementation of Kmeans.

4.The python script PlotScript consists of the code for performing the PCA and plotting the results obtained from the Java files of KMeans_Hadoop.

5.The results obatained from the Java implementations are read into PlotScript.py as a text file. The respective data file is also to be read in the script. This script is then run to obtain the required PCA and Plots for the two Kmeans implentations.

6.The file paths and file names need to be changed to the required datasets in all the above files to run code for required datasets.
